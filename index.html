            <p>As I worked on my first project, I was able to learn how HTML is used to create a webpage. HTML entails the use of tags and elements and it is the basic language for creating a webpage. I was able to make a website for The Little Taco Shop.</p>

            <p>While working on this project, I learned how CSS can be used to make a website more appealing to the eye. I combined both CSS and HTML and ended up with a beautiful Taco shop website.</p>

            <p>Here, I learned about using Tailwind CSS. The setting up of Tailwind was the most tricky part. I was able to create a website for Acme Rockets which included incorporating icons and theme configuration.</p>

                <p>June Biwott is a 17-year-old girl who is passionate about technology. I recently finished high school at The Alliance Girls' High School. I volunteer every Sunday in church in projecting. I have been able to learn a lot about computers through that. I decided to learn with DirectEd since the opportunity is very nice and I have always wanted to learn about coding but I always lack the chance due to lack of funds. This has therefore provided me the opportunity to pursue my passion.</p>
